                <h2>About Me!</h2>
                <p>Hi! I am Dan and I am learning to be a full stack developer currently living in Adelaide. I have moved to Australia from the UK and have fallen in love with my new home. I enjoy problem-solving and have a strong attention to detail, coupled with a desire to help others and create has led me down the path of coding and web development. My career has not taken a straight path however the ups and downs have bought me here and I wouldn't look to change a thing about it as it has given me a strong insight into end user experience and how customers want to engage with websites. Outside of coding I enjoy sports, travelling and trying to cook different foods experienced on my travels!</p>
